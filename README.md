# Virtual-Memory-Simulator

Implemented a virtual memory simulator that uses a 32 line page table, with 1KB pages, a physical address space of 1GB, and a virtual address space of 4GB. 
  Only four of the pages could be in RAM at a time. 
  Implemented the clock page replacement algorithm.

Progam reads a text file that contains the virtual addresses and runs the algorithm on it.

The file can be tested by providing one of the text file as an argument. The output text file will contain "out" on its name.
